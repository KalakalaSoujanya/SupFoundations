<p>Whats a life without a memorable childhood</p>
<p align="justify">The greatest injustice that can be bestowed upon a child is a denial of a memorable childhood. We all wish that our children get the wonderful experience of a childhood.But,life is a different course altogether.For our first project,we interacted with 60 children in which most of them had faced the untold horror of sexual and mental harassment.They are the ones who bravely limp back to normalcy.We spent an entire day with them,conducting painting competitions,providing food,snacks, and stationery items do not mention having those wonderful interactions as well.
But we do not want to just stop there.As part of Project AKSHARA, we have decided that our bond will not be a one-off interaction.Our team of corporate employees and Engineering students will make regular visits to the selected Orphanage homes along with professionals to provide academic and co-curricular assistance to the children.This is as part of our fierce resolve to transform the lives of those innocent children who have faced hardships very early in their lives and bring them back to a normal life.Providing quality education,ethics and motivation are our primary goal.We would be using innovative methods to teach by using cartoons,stories,books,extempore and much more.
It’s a privilege for us to do what we love to and nothing beats helping those needy children.Be a part of Supriya Foundation and contribute to the betterment of wonderful souls.</p>

       <center><h4><b>SAHARA PROJECT</b></h4></center>
<p align="justify">We Supriya Foundation in collaboration with Zenith group would like to proudly announce that we are in the process of adopting/helping an old age home situated in Uppal,Hyderabad.This old age home has 12 members,majority of whom have ripened to an old age not too far from 100.We are hosting an event there on Saturday(19/03/2016),where we will be giving the old age home a hygiene makeover.
1.We will be installing a water purifier which is branded and proven,in order to provide clean and safe drinking water to all in the old age home.
2.We have taken up the task of installing mesh in all the windows of every room.
3.We will be providing clean and quality bedsheets,pillows and rubber sheets apart from two sets of summer clothes to each of them.
This is just the beginning,we would be coming up with more goodwill activities soon to make the old age home more hygienic and a better place overall to live.
All this would not be possible without the dedicated support and collaboration of zenith who have shared our enthusiasm in supporting the old age home.
This is project Sahara,a project to change the lives of the needy.</p>

        <center><h4><b> HUG PROJECT</b></h4></center>
<p align="justify">And here we go kick starting the Project closest to our hearts 
<br>The Hug Project.In the world that is conservative, in a country that is reeling under the effects of superstition and effectively crippling the sanity of the denizens we want to make a difference. No qualms about mingling with the ones who are otherwise made to go through the unsavory path of discrimination and quarantine. Helping them is a responsibility, not duty or charity. So here is what we are going to do, to make a difference. We at Supriya Foundation have taken a fervent oath to help and stand with the AIDS patients, leper homes, and mental institutions. They are our responsibility our family.
Clean and light summer clothes. Each one will be provided with 2 sets of summer wear, which would be made of cotton. They definitely need this to get respite from the heat.Clean bed sheets and pillow covers will be provided to maintain general hygiene and cleanliness for all of them.
To provide them respite from the scorching summer heat, we will be providing fans to each of the 16 rooms. The management is doing a wonderful job in covering the huge medical expenses for all and we would like to provide help on this aspect too. The rooms do not have fans and the brave ones struggle to get respite from the heat. Undoubtedly this will be very helpful for them and that is our primary responsibility.
Ours is not a one of help Its a bond that would be firmed up with regular visits for assisting in improving their quality of life. We will make regular visits to continually improve the quality of their lives. It would be to such an extent that social stigmas, superstitions, and misconceptions do not touch them. They are our responsibility and they will be under our care. We have adopted the leper homes under us Where else should they go if not with us? We are family are not we?
We are Supriya Foundation. And we sell and buy happiness!</p>
